# form-code-test
This is a collection of different code exercises I have done for job interviews.

checkForCapital.php - PHP function that checks if the first letter of a string is a capital

format_file.php - Given a data file with set length columns. This will read the data, format it for easy viewing and report errors in data.

formTest.php - A page with a form that uses javascript to validate the inputs and report errors. If the page is submitted successfully, the data is printed at the top of the page.

functions-for-wordpress.php - These functions create two shortcodes for use within WP. The first shortcode will take a given class name and content then wrap that content in a span of the given class. The second shortcode will create an unordered list, however many times you specify, and print content of your choice as the list items.
